      This sidebar gadget is useful to check these events briefly.<br /><br />

      Why iCal Viewer <em>2</em> is because I've once developed same concept

      <h4>Misc.</h4>
      Abount time zone.<br />
      This program checks iCalendar format timezone, and time is converted
      to system timezone.
      iCalendar file must define it's timezone,
      but some times it is not defined.
      So this program has pre-defined timezone ID as follows:
      <ul>
	<li>Asia/Japan </li>
	<li>US/Central</li>
	<li>US/Eastern</li>
	<li>US/Mountain</li>
	<li>US/Pacific</li>
      </ul>
      If other timezone ID is used but no definition,
      timezone is treated as standard time.
      Which means time displayed may not correct.
    </p>
    <p>
      iCalendar format is spcified by RFC5545.<br />
      iCal Viewer 2 shows basic information of VEVENT component and
      VTODO component. VJOURNAL and other component is ignored.
      Repeated events (RRULE, RDATE, etc) is also supported.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Scroll bar<br />
      Scroll bar will be appreared if there is not enough area to show
      information, but unfortunately you can not drag scroll bar.
      Click each side of scroll bar will work.
      I could not find a way to avoid this problem. Is anyone knows?
    </p>
    <p>
      To access iCalendar file on internet, this gadget uses WebLoader.exe
      execution file, which is included in installation image.
      This execution file is based on .Net Framework 4.
      Most web application like this uses javascript XMLHttpRequest class,
      but I got problem when the specified URL is redirected.
      May be because URL site is changed by redirection.
